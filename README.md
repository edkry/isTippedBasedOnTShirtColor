Analysing data if waitress' or waiter's T-Shirt color has an impact if she or he is getting tipped.


It is thought, that customer leave more often tips when the waitress is wearing red T-Shirt. So, let's dive into the data and let's see whether it's true or not.
In our dataset we have these variables:
- Color - indicates the color of t-shirt the waitress is wearing.
- Tipnum - the variable which indicates if customer tipped or not. When tipnum = 1 - customer tipped.
- Male - indicates the client's sex. When male = 1 - client is male.
- Black - When black = 1, it means waitress is wearing black T-Shirt, and when black = 0, it means waitress is not wearing black t-shirt.
- White - "--"
- Yellow - "--"
- Blue - "--"
- Green - "--"
**Note:** when every variable black, white, yellow, blue and green are equal to zero, it that waitress is wearing red t-shirt.
